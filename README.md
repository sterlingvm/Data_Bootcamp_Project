# Overview

## Topic
In our collaborative project, we aimed to build a machine learning model to predict whether a medical patient has COVID-19 based on a variety of factors. We'll be utilizing a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm (RandomForestClassifier) to analyze existing COVID-19 patient data.

## Reason for selecting this topic
With the critical periods of the Pandemic behind us, what we've learned about the illness has become increasingly concrete. With the massive surge of COVID-19 data being released to the public as a means for exploring this illness during the pandemic, our group finds it both practical and relevant to employ our own skills to analyze the probability that somebody has the illness based on various features.

## Plan
- Determine which datasets work best for our proposed topic and subsequent questions
- Build a relational dataset of at least 2 tables using PostgreSQL
- ETL our data into a Google CoLab file
- Clean & Preprocess our Data so that it works well with our model
- Build our Machine Learning Model
- Evaluate Machine Learning Model Results
- Optimize Machine Learning Model
- Evaluate Machine Learning Model Results
- Report Findings

## Questions We Hope To Answer
1) Can we determine the probability that someone has COVID-19 based on a variety of input factors?
2) Is a Random Forest Classifier the best means for creating this analysis? Is a Neural Network better in this case?
3) Does the input data that we provide work well for/in our machine learning model?
4) Can we determine what trends best indicate whether someone has or does not have COVID-19?
